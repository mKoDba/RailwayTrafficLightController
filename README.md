# Railway Traffic Light Controller
Railway Traffic Light Controller Project

This is a faculty project for the fall semester of year 2018/2019 done at FEUP (Faculdade de Engenharia da Universidade do Porto) as part of the course Eletronic Systems/Sistemas Electr√≥nicos (SELE).

Authors are Joel Vaz and Mario Kodba.

Goals of the project are:

- design a robust railway traffic light control system, which controls one green and one red light, based on a microcontroller ATMEGA328p

- use two types of communication protocols (synchronous and asynchronous)

- use memory testing algorithms

- follow and stick to particular coding guideline (for example MISRA C)

- use professional development methodology: project management, proper debugging techniques, use of version control

- design and implement the laboratorial prototype using LEDS, sensors and microcontroller

- design electrical scheme and PCB industrial prototype using EAGLE CAD
